# CS 250 Final Project: Software Development with Agile

## Sprint Review and Retrospective
This repository contains my final project deliverables for CS 250, including the Script Review and Retrospective document, which reflects on the Agile processes, user story implementation, and teamwork throughout the course.

## Journal Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
I interpret the user needs by analyzing user stories and breaking them down into clear, actionable requirements. These helped me focus on the end-user's expectations and create program features that solve the real problems. In aligning the features with the user stories, I am ensuring the final product meets its intended purpose.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I begin with planning and outlining the program structure, followed by incremental coding and regular testing. I rely on Agile principles to manage my time and development flow, using sprints to prioritize tasks and adapt when needed. I also focus on writing clean, reusable code that is easy to maintain.

### What Agile processes do I want to incorporate into my future development work?
I plan to use Scrum-based Agile practices like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint retrospectives. These processes help me track progress, improve collaboration, and allow for flexibility when project requirements evolve. I also appreciate the emphasis Agile places on feedback and continuous improvement.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I would say that being a good team member means being reliable, communicative, and supportive. It involves being an active listener, giving constructive feedback, and having accountability. I've learned that great teamwork is built on trust and collaboration, especially when using Agile methods that rely on group contributions to achieve goals.
